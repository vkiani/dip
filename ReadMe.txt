Introduction to Image Processing in Python

This GitHub project contains supplementary material for the textbook, including Jupyter Notebooks and Images. Python notebooks of each chapter are located at a separate folder. All notebooks are executed by the author and all codes would work. The book is originally written in Persian language.

Digital image processing is one of the advanced fields in engineering and computer science that examines and analyzes images using computational algorithms. Image processing is used in many industries such as security, automotive, robotics, medicine, etc. Digital image processing will play a very important role in advanced and technological industries in the future. In this book, it has been tried to familiarize the Persian reader with the most important concepts and algorithms of image processing and at the same time learn how to implement them with the help of the OpenCV-Python library. About 100 practical examples are presented by the author, which show how to use different algorithms. This book is self-paced and helps you learn image processing in Python with step-by-step examples. 

The organization of the book is as follows. The first chapters of the book are dedicated to explaining the fundamentals and introduce you how to install the necessary tools and basic Python libraries. Then, the basic operations in image processing and simple filterings are discussed in the following chapters. The final chapters of the book are dedicated to advanced operations in image processing, including intermediate and high-level operations, feature points, morphological operators, camera calibration, and depth information acquisition. Examples from the book are available at https://github.com/vkiani/dip.

The author has tried to provide you with a useful collection by addressing the most important concepts and methods in image processing. Since no human work is perfect, the defects of this work can be noticed and corrected by submitting your comments in the next editions.
As the author of the book, I will be happy if you let me know your suggestions for the development of the book by email. Also, if you are willing to cooperate, I welcome your cooperation in the next revisions of the book as a co-author.

Sincerely,
